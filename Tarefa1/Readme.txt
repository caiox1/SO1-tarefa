First homework in Operacional System FATECZL
Professor: Leandro Colevati

1. Create a Java application in Eclipse with a operation that receives an array of 1000 integer positions (filling all positions with the value 0) and calculates the time, in seconds, to traverse the array. Repeat for 10000 and 100000 positions. The application should have a control class with methods for operations and a view class that instantiates the control class for communication. The task response should be console prints for each time.

2. Develop a Java application in Eclipse with an operation that allows entering a text, as shown below, via Scanner or JOptionPane. Split the text and display the number of parts. The application should have a control class with methods for operations and a view class that instantiates the control class for communication. The task response should be console prints with the quantities.
